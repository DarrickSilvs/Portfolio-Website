# My Portfolio Website
A minimalist, terminal-style portfolio website inspired by a retro BIOS interface. It supports basic commands like help and cd, along with tab autocomplete for navigation. Visitors can explore my work through a stripped-down, command-line experience that highlights simplicity and creativity.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React

Built with React to simulate a terminal-style interface in the browser. The site supports a minimal set of commands like help and cd, with tab autocomplete for smoother navigation. I used simple state management and command parsing logic to handle user input and render dynamic content. The BIOS-inspired look is achieved using custom CSS and monospaced fonts to evoke a retro, boot-screen aesthetic.

## Lessons Learned:

Building a functional fake terminal taught me a lot about managing input state, keyboard events, and non-traditional UX flows. It also reminded me that simple HTML and CSS can still create unique experiences when used creatively. Most importantly, I saw how fun it can be to build something that reflects personality, not just functionality.
